# Tamagotchi
This is an adapted version of the 1990s toy tamagotchi. It uses the same premise but has a fewer features that are tweaked.
It was made on Eclipse through Java.
You start with a pet in which you can use button icons to select tools to interact. Buttons can feed, clean, heal, or view pet stats.
Text will appear to give instructions for the player and stats keep track of what the player has done. Interactions are recognized by the program through clicking and hovering detections.
Game uses decorator and factory patterns to style the code in a more organized and professional manner.
